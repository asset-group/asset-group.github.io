The aim of this project is to employ rigorous software 
engineering principles for designing robust decision 
making systems (e.g., robust and secure artificial intelligent 
and machine-learning systems). To this end, we focus on 
various desirable properties of decision making systems, 
including but not limited to security (e.g., resilience against 
adversarial and backdoor attacks), robustness and fairness 
(i.e., removing social discrimination). In this topic, we have 
made some of the pioneering contributions, specifically, to 
discover inherent bias in AI/ML software. In terms of practical 
impact, our proposed techniques for functional and fairness testing 
methodologies have discovered hundreds and thousands of bugs in 
well-established AI/ML models developed or used by popular software 
industries including but not limited to Google, Microsoft, IBM, 
Amazon and Airbnb.
