The aim of this project is to employ rigorous software 
engineering principles for designing robust decision 
making systems (e.g. robust and secure artificial intelligent 
and machine-learning systems). To this end, we focus on 
various desirable properties of decision making systems, 
including but not limited to security (e.g. resilience against 
adversarial and backdoor attacks), robustness and fairness 
(i.e. removing social discrimination). Another focus of 
the project is the systematic usage of artificial 
intelligent (AI) systems to detect cyber attacks and explain 
their cause. To know more about the topic, take a look at the 
following publications:
