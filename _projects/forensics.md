Emerging technologies such as IoT and smart city infrastructure (SCI) entice 
adversaries and cybercriminals to execute cyber-attacks and commit criminal acts on these modern
infrastructures. Given the borderless nature of cyber attacks, varying levels of understanding 
of emerging systems (such as SCI and IoT) and ongoing investigation workloads, law enforcement 
agencies and investigators are hard-pressed to respond to these kinds of cybercrime. In this 
project, we conceptualize and design technologies to aid forensics investigation in emerging 
class of systems such as SCI, IoT and beyond 5G systems. Our designed technologies have been 
evaluated with over 30 real-life forensic investigators working in Singapore Government agencies 
and was shown to significantly accelerate IoT forensic investigation. We have made pioneering 
contributions to develop an abstract, yet systematic framework for forensic analysis that 
cover all SCI systems at an appropriate level of abstraction. Such framework was developed 
from the foundations of threat modeling in SCI systems. Our current work focuses on instantiation 
of our conceptual framework for a variety of complex systems such as 5G and beyond. Apart from 
the forensic angle, we are investigating the user perception of software risks in critical domain. 
Among others, we are investigating the risks (that are due to intended features) to end users in 
using smart contract and how to automatically identify and highlight such risks to them.
