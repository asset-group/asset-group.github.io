In this project, we investigate systematic and automated testing 
of (IIoT) Wireless Protocols. Our initial work on over-the-air 
fuzzing has uncovered critical security vulnerabilities in popular 
wireless devices (currently undisclosed for confidentiality). Three 
CVEs have been assigned so far for the discovered Wi-Fi vulnerabilities: 
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12586" target="_blank">CVE-2019-12586</a>, 
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12587" target="_blank">CVE-2019-12587</a> and 
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12588" target="_blank">CVE-2019-12588 </a>. 
Details of <a href="https://asset-group.github.io/cves.html">12 more CVEs</a> 
will be disclosed on 9th February, 2020. We have also been assigned a bug 
bounty of 2.2K USD for finding a vulnerability that allow hijacking IoT 
devices to connect to enterprise network. Finally, our work has been 
succesfully deployed and tested on a real car (Toyota Altis 2016 version) 
to discover security vulnerabilities. We are massively expanding our work to 
provide a holistic and systematic framework for arbitrary wireless 
IoT device validation and testing. Our current work will soon be 
available in public as a technical report and tool. This work is 
also related to cyber-physical systems that support wireless access.
