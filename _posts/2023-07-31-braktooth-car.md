A group of security researchers at Star-V Lab launched and tested <a href="https://www.braktooth.com">BrakTooth</a> in many 
cars. It was great to see their comprehensive report on  
<a href="https://rollingpwn.github.io/Braktooth-IVI-Report/">BrakTooth Hunting in Cars</a> and see 
the impact of <a href="https://www.braktooth.com">BrakTooth</a> going way beyond our tested subjects. Very cool work by Star-V Lab.
