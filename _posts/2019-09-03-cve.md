Quoting a user from Hacker News: <i>"It [ESP8266] is a Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller locally designed and produced 
in china with a "100 million units sold" target. It is widely used by the makers community and by many new 
"smart" products. I would say that this has a really large scale impact and a lot of people will need to 
update the firmware"</i>.
