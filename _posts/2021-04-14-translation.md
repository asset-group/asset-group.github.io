Our <a href="https://asset-group.github.io/papers/Greyhound.pdf">Greyhound Fuzzer</a> (for both Wi-Fi and BLE) 
is now successfully integrated to a commercial pen testing tool used by major automotive industry (names 
undisclosed due to confidentiality). They have subesequently used the Greyhound component to discover new 
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. We are glad to see the translation, commercial success and effectiveness 
at industrial scale within just two years of the inception of Greyhound project at ASSET group.
