<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/wangc">Chundong Wang</a> from our group will join 
as a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the 
<a href="http://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/">ShanghaiTech University</a> from early 2020. 
Chundong was one of the first members to join our group and he has made extremely valuable 
contributions to the ASSET group research. While we will certainly miss Chundong, at the same 
time, we are extremely proud of his achievements and will look forward to his research 
as he moves on to the next level of his career.

Congratulations Chundong!!
