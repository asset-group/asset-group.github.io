Today we released <a href="https://www.5ghoul.com">5Ghoul</a> -- a family of 5G implementation 
vulnerabilities (10 CVEs) that affect 5G cellular baseband modems from major vendors i.e., Qualcomm 
and MediaTek. We demonstrate concrete exploitation of 5Ghoul vulnerabilities to continuously 
launch attacks to drop the connections, freeze the connection that involves manual reboot or 
downgrade the 5G connectivity to 4G.
Based on the <a href="https://www.kimovil.com/en/">Kimovil</a> listings and December security 
bulletin from <a href="https://docs.qualcomm.com/product/publicresources/securitybulletin/december-2023-bulletin.html">Qualcomm</a> 
and <a href="https://corp.mediatek.com/product-security-bulletin/December-2023">MediaTek</a>, we (under)-estimate that 
over <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13TQDN0wWWEOaBlj3RJfxoeOM92vqE4B5qihzvGg-qQM/edit#gid=0">710 different smartphone models</a> 
to be affected along with other 5G IoT devices. If you are a 5G module or device maker, or 
simply interested in 5G research, feel free to read the  <a href="https://www.5ghoul.com">5Ghoul Disclosure</a> 
and get back to us via <font color="red"><b>contact@5ghoul.com</b></font> for any question. 
The exploit code and fuzzing tool for 5Ghoul is  <a href="https://github.com/asset-group/5ghoul-5g-nr-attacks">open source</a> 
for research and experimentation.
