<a href="https://asset-group.github.io/disclosures/sweyntooth/">SweynTooth</a> and ASSET group 
featured in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bluetooth-flaws-ble-internet-of-things-pacemakers">WIRED</a> 
(top technology journal in the world) and 30+ news articles (and also <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/security-now/episodes/754">podcasts</a>) 
in English as well as in Non-English languages all over the world. I am glad to say that the work is almost single handedly pulled 
off by a first-year PhD student <a href="https://matheus-garbelini.github.io/home/">Matheus Eduardo</a> 
in the ASSET group.
