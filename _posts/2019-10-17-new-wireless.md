<a href="https://asset-group.github.io/cves.html">12 new CVEs</a> assigned to show how to cause havoc in 
wireless systems (currently undisclosed for confidentiality). The vulnerabilities affect millions of 
wireless products being used. If you are in a "smart" nation, then you are almost certainly at risk (we 
are currently in the 90-day responsible disclosure window). Watch this space on 
<font color="red"><b>9th February, 2020</b></font> when we disclose the exploits and the details.
