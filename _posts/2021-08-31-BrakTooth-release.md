Today we released <a href="www.braktooth.com">BrakTooth</a> -- a family of 16 new security
vulnerabilities (20+ CVEs) in commercial Bluetooth classic (BR/EDR) stacks that range from
denial of service (DoS) via firmware crashes and deadlocks in commodity hardware to arbitrary
code execution (ACE) in certain IoTs. <a href="www.braktooth.com">BrakTooth</a> affects major
System-on-chip (SoC) vendors such as Intel, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Infineon (Cypress),
Silicon Labs among others. Bluetooth listings capture over 1400 products to be affected, including
but not limited to Laptops and smartphones from major vendors (e.g. Dell, HP, Samsung, Microsoft etc.),
Automotive Infotainment systems, Aircraft Entertainment systems, Speakers and Headphones.
If you are a Bluetooth module or SoC vendor, feel free to request the proof of concept tool here:
