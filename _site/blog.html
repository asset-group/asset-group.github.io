Our <a href="https://asset-group.github.io/papers/Greyhound.pdf">Greyhound Fuzzer</a> (for both Wi-Fi and BLE) 
is now successfully integrated into a commercial pen testing tool used by major automotive industry (names 
undisclosed due to confidentiality). They have subsequently used the Greyhound component to discover new 
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. We are glad to see the translation, commercial success and effectiveness 
at industrial scale within just two years of the inception of Greyhound project at ASSET group.

Our work on over-the-air fuzzing is tested today on a real car: Toyota Altis 2016 version 
and automatically discovered <a href="https://www.krackattacks.com/" target="_blank">KRACK</a>
together with other anomalous behaviour in the Wi-Fi implementation. If you are using the same 
car, then you MUST update the firmware (if you haven't done so already).

Great work Matheus!!
