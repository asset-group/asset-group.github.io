Currently, this list contains only the service of the faculty lead (Sudipta). 
<br>
<font color="red"><b>NOTE:</b></font>
I am open to review papers for conferences and journals that incorporate 
topics in (embedded) systems, real-time/cyber-physical systems, software 
engineering and software security. <font color="blue"><b>I review all papers myself</b></font>, 
i.e., I read all the papers I get for review and I write reviews myself. Of course, time 
to time, I seek opinions about a paper from another ASSET group member when 
I feel that the person is more expert than myself for the topic targeted in the paper.  
<br>
There is one catch. In recent times, I have received invitations from several 
(well known) journals that request me to 
complete review within seven (7) days (No!!! these are not journal revisions and 
these are not short papers). I decline all invitations that request me to submit 
reviews in <b>less than two weeks</b> (YES!!!, I do suggest alternate 
reviewers). Exceptions exist, such as letters (which are short) and journal 
revisions (especially, minor revisions).
